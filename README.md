# The "Birthday" function

This repository contains a Python script that implements a function for generating a list of colleagues to greet on their birthdays in the upcoming week. 
The script takes a list of user dictionaries as input, where each dictionary must have the keys 'name' (a string representing the user's name) and 'birthday' (a datetime.date object containing the user's birthdate).

Additionally, this repository includes a testing script (check_homework.py) to verify the functionality of the get_birthdays_per_week function. 

### Usage:
    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/alex-nuclearboy/goit-birthdays-function.git
    # Navigate to the script directory
    cd goit-birthdays-function
    # Run the testing script
    python3 check_homework.py
